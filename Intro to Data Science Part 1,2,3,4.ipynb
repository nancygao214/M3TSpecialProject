    "It is important to learn about the different types of graphs python can help us plot. But more importantly, we should recognise those graphs as part of our tool box and that choosing the appropriate types of graphs is more important for the purpose of gaining relevant information. We have now seen how to plot bar charts, histograms and line graphs, but as we explore further our given dataset, we may also find other plots such as scatter plots more useful. We may also want to overlay two plots on top of each other for comparison. \n",

    "I hope this series on Intro to Data Science can act as an inspiration for you to dig deeper and explore further many other exciting things that is possible within Python and Jupyter Notebook. Do use this opportunity (this notebook) to investigate other aspects of the dataset we have not touched on, and perhaps write a report on your findings. Do not limit yourselves to this notebook! Google codes that you did not fully understand, read about them through other tutorials, try and find this dataset on Kaggle.com, watch YouTube videos etc. This is only the beginning of your journey to becoming a great data scientist!\n",
